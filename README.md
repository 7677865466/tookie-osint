# Our repo is temporarily back for some time. it will be called "tookie-osint" untill this is fully settled.

# üîé Overview (We Changed Our Logo)
tookie-osint has a simple-to-use UI and is really straightforward. 
The main idea of tookie-osint is to discover usernames that are requested from an input.
tookie-osint is similar to the tool called Sherlock. It discovers all the user accounts across different websites and tookie-osint is successful at this task almost 80% of the time.
Our tool was created by me and the community and is available for your use. 
I do not take responsibility for any malicious actions and/or responsibility caused by my tool. :(
Please note that tookie-osint was created to help new programmers or pentesters get into the world of OSINT. My end term goal is to make tookie-osint as perfect as I can and make it easy for new programmers to understand. Also take note that tookie-osint is optimized for Python 3.12. If you want to contribute, make a fork and make a pull request to submit your changes. :D
