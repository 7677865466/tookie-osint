# 🔎 Overview (We Changed Our Logo)
Alfred has a simple-to-use UI and is really straightforward. 
The main idea of Alfred is to discover usernames that are requested from an input.
Alfred is similar to the tool called Sherlock. It discovers all the user accounts across different websites and Alfred is successful at this task almost 80% of the time.
Our tool was created by me and the community and is available for your use. 
I do not take responsibility for any malicious actions and/or responsibility caused by my tool. :(
Please note that Alfred was created to help new programmers or pentesters get into the world of OSINT. My end term goal is to make Alfred as perfect as I can and make it easy for new programmers to understand. Also take note that Alfred is optimized for Python 3.12. If you want to contribute, make a fork and make a pull request to submit your changes. :D

    As our community was mass reported, and now our bot has come to an end.
